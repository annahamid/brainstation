//First, I will declare my variable as an empty string and call it "hash"
var hash = "";
//To create this triangle, I will write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log:

 for (i = 0; i <= 7; i++) { //this For loop executes 7 times
    console.log(hash); // this will produce each new row
    hash += "#"; //this declares "#" as the constant that gets displayed on each new row, incrementing by one "#" as per the For Loop.
 }
