//Since a number is either even or odd, we can use a binary IF statement. We can determine whether a number is even or odd using the modulo operator.
//Declare function:
function isEven(number) {
 // There is a possibility that a non-number is inputted. in this case, we use parsefloat and the following message will be displayed:
   if(isNaN(number)){
    console.log ("This is not a number");
//else ,the input is a number, and if it does NOT have a remainder of 2,it quaifies as an even number 
  } else if(number %2 == 0){
    console.log ("This number is even"); 
    //else, it qualifies as an odd number:
  } else {
    console.log ("This number is odd");
  }
};
// All possibilities have been satified since numbers are either odd or even and this function also accounts for input that may not be numbers.


//testing...
isEven (2);
isEven(42);
isEven(7853);
isEven("food"); //I noticed that my code returns an error when I don't use quotation marks... I'm not so confident that I've covered all types of input..
